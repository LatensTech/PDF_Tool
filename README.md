# **Potentia PDF Tool**  
_Your documents. Your rules._  

---

## **Why this exists**  

Most “free” PDF tools aren’t free.  
They watermark your files, limit your pages, or throw ads in your face.  
Some even make you sign up before you can do **one** conversion.  

We built **Potentia PDF Tool** because:  
- You should be able to turn your images into a clean, well-branded PDF **in seconds**.  
- You shouldn’t have to pay Microsoft or Adobe just to merge two PDFs.  
- You deserve **simplicity and control back** — no hidden steps, no shady cloud uploads.

## **What it does (right now)**  

**1️⃣ Convert images → PDF**  
- Perfectly ordered pages  
- Adds a subtle “_Prepared by [Your Name]_” tag to each page (bottom right)  
- Leaves your content untouched  

**2️⃣ Merge PDFs** — combine multiple PDFs into one clean file.  

**3️⃣ Split PDF** — extract just the pages you need.  

**4️⃣ Compress PDF** — make them smaller without killing the quality.
