Potentia PDF Tool

Your documents. Your rules.

Why this exists

Most “free” PDF tools aren’t free. They watermark your files, limit your pages, or throw ads in your face.
Some even make you sign up before you can do one conversion.

We built Potentia PDF Tool because:

You should be able to turn your images into a clean, well-branded PDF in seconds.

You shouldn’t have to pay Microsoft or Adobe just to merge two PDFs.

You deserve simplicity and control back — no hidden steps, no shady cloud uploads.

What it does (right now)

1️⃣ Convert images → PDF

Perfectly ordered pages

Adds a subtle “Prepared by [Your Name]” tag to each page (bottom right)

Leaves your content untouched

2️⃣ Merge PDFs — combine multiple PDFs into one clean file.

3️⃣ Split PDF — extract just the pages you need.

4️⃣ Compress PDF — make them smaller without killing the quality.
